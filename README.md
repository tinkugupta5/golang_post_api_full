# üìò Go CRUD API with PostgreSQL

This project is a RESTful API built using **Golang (Gin framework)** and **PostgreSQL**. It provides basic user authentication and allows users to create, view, update, and delete posts, as well as add comments to posts.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **User Registration & Login** (with JWT authentication)
- üìù **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations on Posts
- üí¨ **Comment System** (any user can comment on any post)
- üîê **Authorization**: 
  - Only the **owner** of a post can update or delete it
  - Comments are **immutable** (cannot be edited or deleted)
- üîÑ **Cascade delete**: When a post is deleted, all associated comments are also deleted
- üßæ **Post Structure**: `title` and `description`

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-crud-post-api.git
cd go-crud-post-api
```

### 2. Configure `.env`

Create a `.env` file with your PostgreSQL credentials:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=postdb
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 3. Create Database

Create a PostgreSQL database named `postdb` using pgAdmin or psql CLI.

### 4. Run the Server

```bash
go run main.go
```

Server will run at: `http://localhost:8080`

# üìò Database Configuration PostgreSQL

# üõ† STEP 1: Create PostgreSQL Database (`postdb`)

This step explains how to create the PostgreSQL database required by the Go CRUD API project.

---

## ‚úÖ Option 1: Using `psql` Command Line

If you have PostgreSQL and `psql` CLI installed, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
psql -U postgres
```

> Replace `postgres` with your PostgreSQL username if it's different. You‚Äôll be prompted to enter your password (default might be `postgres`).

2. Inside the PostgreSQL shell, run:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE postdb;
```

3. Exit the shell:

```sql
\q
```

---

## ‚úÖ Option 2: Using pgAdmin (GUI)

If you prefer a graphical interface:

1. **Open pgAdmin 4** (installed along with PostgreSQL).
2. Login with your PostgreSQL credentials.
3. In the left panel:
   - Expand `Servers ‚Üí PostgreSQL ‚Üí Databases`
4. Right-click on **Databases** ‚Üí Click **Create ‚Üí Database**.
5. **Name** the database: `postdb`
6. Leave other settings as default and click **Save**.

---

Once the database is created, your application will be able to connect to it as long as your `.env` file is correctly configured.
