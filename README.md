# üìò Go CRUD API with PostgreSQL

This project is a RESTful API built using **Golang (Gin framework)** and **PostgreSQL**. It provides basic user authentication and allows users to create, view, update, and delete posts, as well as add comments to posts.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ **User Registration & Login** (with JWT authentication)
- üìù **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations on Posts
- üí¨ **Comment System** (any user can comment on any post)
- üîê **Authorization**: 
  - Only the **owner** of a post can update or delete it
  - Comments are **immutable** (cannot be edited or deleted)
- üîÑ **Cascade delete**: When a post is deleted, all associated comments are also deleted
- üßæ **Post Structure**: `title` and `description`
